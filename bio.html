            <p class="bio-text">Paul Casso is a nom de plume, as one might guess. He is not a relative of a certain "Pi Casso", if one's imagination had begun to stray.<br><br>
            The artist has had some formal artistic training however, he is largely self-trained. He is mostly influenced by real world experiences, theatre, music, a lifetime of observations and disparate, exotic travels.<br><br>
            Paul Casso would like to share some of his more recent works with the rest of the world to bring joy, enlightenment, and possibly inspiration to others to take up a brush, pencil, charcoal, pen or just a marker and express themselves.</p>
